# Car_Parking_Spaces_Counter

## 1)- Problem:
### Parking lots are often crowded and difficult to find a parking space in. This can lead to traffic congestion and frustration for drivers.

## 2)- Solution: 
### The car parking space counter project uses computer vision techniques to detect cars in a parking lot and count the number of empty and occupied spaces. This information can be used to help drivers find a parking space more easily and improve traffic flow.

## 3)- Approach: 
### The project first extracts the parking lot coordinates from an image. These coordinates are then used to process each parking space individually. The project uses a combination of thresholding, edge detection, and color segmentation to detect cars in a parking space. Once a car is detected, the space is marked as occupied.

## 4)- Implementation: 
### The project is implemented in Python and uses the OpenCV library for image processing. The project is divided into two main parts:
####     -> Image processing: This part of the project extracts the parking lot coordinates from an image and processes each parking space individually.
####     -> Data analysis: This part of the project counts the number of empty and occupied spaces and displays the results.

## 5)- Evaluation: 
### The project was tested on a variety of parking lot images and was able to accurately detect cars and count the number of empty and occupied spaces. The project was also able to handle a variety of lighting conditions and different types of cars.

## 6)- Future work: 
### The project could be improved by using more advanced computer vision techniques, such as deep learning. The project could also be extended to track the movement of cars in a parking lot.
